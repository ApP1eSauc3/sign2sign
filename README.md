# Sign2Sign

Field operations app for sign installation and removal crews. Drivers use a codeless mobile app to work through daily job routes, capture GPS-tagged photos, and mark jobs complete. Admins manage routes, generate daily codes, and import jobs from Google Sheets — on iOS or Windows.

## Overview

Sign2Sign solves a coordination problem for sign installation companies: crews need job-by-job instructions in the field without requiring accounts, and admins need real-time visibility into job completion with photographic proof.

**Two user types, two separate worlds:**

| Role | Platform | Auth method |
|---|---|---|
| Driver | iOS (Expo Go / standalone) | 6-digit daily code — no account required |
| Admin | iOS + Windows (Electron) | Email/password via Supabase Auth |

Key constraints driving every architectural decision:
- Drivers may have poor connectivity mid-route — offline queue handles this
- Screens are read in under 2 seconds in direct sunlight — WCAG AAA contrast is the minimum
- Gloved hands operate the UI — 56pt minimum touch targets throughout
- Photo proof is mandatory before any job can be marked complete — no exceptions

---

## Architecture

```
src/data/         Types, enums, interfaces. No imports from this project.
src/services/     Async layer: Supabase, Storage, Google Sheets, Auth. No React.
src/stores/       Zustand state machines. Orchestrate services. No React.
src/utils/        Pure helpers, colour tokens. No domain imports.
src/screens/      React Native UI. Only layer with JSX. Reads stores, calls actions.
src/navigation/   React Navigation stacks and param lists. No business logic.
```

**Strict one-way dependency rule:**

```
screens → stores → services → data
              ↘           ↗
               utils ────
```

No layer may import from a layer above it. Screens never call Supabase directly.

## Database Schema

### `route_codes`

Daily codes — one per driver slot. Expire at 06:00 the following morning so drivers finishing late jobs are not locked out mid-shift.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | uuid PK | `gen_random_uuid()` |
| `code` | text UNIQUE | 6-digit string |
| `driver_slot` | int | "Driver 1", "Driver 2", etc. |
| `created_date` | date | Date the code was generated |
| `expires_at` | timestamptz | 06:00 the following morning |
| `is_active` | boolean | `false` when replaced or manually revoked |

### `jobs`

Individual sign installation or removal tasks. Imported from Google Sheets and linked to a route code.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | uuid PK | `gen_random_uuid()` |
| `route_code_id` | uuid FK | References `route_codes(id)` ON DELETE CASCADE |
| `client_name` | text | Property owner |
| `agent_name` | text | Real estate agent name |
| `agent_email` | text | Pre-loaded from Sheets — no manual lookup |
| `address` | text | Job site address |
| `sign_description` | text | Sign type/size |
| `job_type` | text | `'install'` or `'removal'` |
| `latitude` | float | Job site coordinates |
| `longitude` | float | Job site coordinates |
| `sort_order` | int | Display order within route |
| `is_complete` | boolean | Set after mark-complete |
| `photo_key` | text | Supabase Storage key — never a signed URL |
| `photo_gps_lat` | float | GPS at upload time |
| `photo_gps_lng` | float | GPS at upload time |
| `photo_timestamp` | timestamptz | Timestamp at upload time |

### RLS Policies

All four migrations contribute policies. The anon key (drivers) can only satisfy the public policies. Admin policies require a valid Supabase Auth session (`auth.role() = 'authenticated'`). The service role key is never shipped in the app.

| Policy | Table | Operation | Who |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Public read active codes` | `route_codes` | SELECT | Anon (drivers) — `is_active AND expires_at > now()` |
| `Public read jobs for active codes` | `jobs` | SELECT | Anon (drivers) — job's code is active and non-expired |
| `Drivers can update photo fields for active jobs` | `jobs` | UPDATE | Anon — job belongs to active code; photo fields + `is_complete` only |
| `Admins can insert jobs` | `jobs` | INSERT | Authenticated |
| `Admins can update jobs` | `jobs` | UPDATE | Authenticated |
| `Admins can insert route codes` | `route_codes` | INSERT | Authenticated |
| `Admins can update route codes` | `route_codes` | UPDATE | Authenticated |
| `Admins can read all route codes` | `route_codes` | SELECT | Authenticated — includes inactive/historical (for audit) |
| `Admins can read all jobs` | `jobs` | SELECT | Authenticated — survives code expiry (route detail screen works next morning) |

---

## Authentication Model

### Admin

1. Admin opens app → selects Admin mode → enters email and password
2. `AuthService.signIn()` calls `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword()`
3. On success, `useAppStore` sets `AppMode.AdminAuthenticated`
4. Root navigator renders the Admin stack

### Driver (codeless)

Drivers have no Supabase Auth accounts. The 6-digit code is the credential.

1. Driver opens app → selects Driver mode → enters 6-digit code
2. `RouteCodeService.loadSession(code)` queries `route_codes` with the anon key
3. RLS validates the code is active and non-expired
4. On match, the full job list is returned and the Driver stack renders
5. `supabase.auth` is never called for drivers

### Daily code generation

1. Admin taps "Generate Codes" on the dashboard
2. `RouteCodeService.generateDailyCodes([1, 2, 3, ...])` runs per slot:
   - Deactivates any existing active code for that slot today
   - Inserts a new 6-digit code with expiry at 06:00 tomorrow
   - Retries up to 5 times on a 6-digit collision (Postgres constraint `23505`)
3. Admin shares codes with drivers verbally or via the dashboard display

---

## Core Flows

### Job Import

1. Admin connects Google account via `GoogleConnectScreen`
2. Pastes a Google Sheets URL containing job data
3. `GoogleSheetsService.importJobs(sheetId)` fetches rows via Sheets API v4
4. Caller writes the resulting `SignJob[]` to Supabase, linked to a `route_code_id`
5. `agent_email` is captured at import time — no manual lookup later

### Photo Capture and Upload

The upload state machine enforces the photo gate:

```
idle → capturing → preview → uploading → succeeded
                     ↓                        ↑
                    idle (retake)      failed → capturing (retry)
```

1. Driver taps "Take Photo" → `capturePhoto()` opens camera
2. Photo displayed for review — driver confirms or retakes
3. On confirm, the screen requests location permission, reads current GPS coordinates, and passes them to `confirmAndUpload(jobId, location)` — services never read GPS directly
4. `JobPhotoService.uploadPhoto()` resizes the image (max 1600px), uploads to `job-photos` bucket, writes storage key + GPS to the job record
5. `canMarkComplete(jobId)` returns `true` only when state is `succeeded`
6. Driver taps "Mark Complete" — `JobPhotoService.markJobComplete()` sets `is_complete = true`

**GPS is captured at upload time, not assignment time.** The store reads location and passes it as a parameter — services never read GPS directly.

**Storage keys, never signed URLs.** The `photo_key` column stores the Supabase Storage path string (e.g. `jobs/abc123/1234567890.jpg`). Signed URLs are generated at display time with a 1-hour TTL and never persisted.

### Offline Queue

If the device has no connectivity when a driver confirms a photo:

1. `OfflineQueueService.enqueue()` persists the upload operation to AsyncStorage
2. Upload state is set to `failed` with message: `"No connection — photo queued and will upload automatically when online."`
3. On next session load (when connectivity returns), `flushOfflineQueue()` replays queued operations
4. Retaking a photo calls `OfflineQueueService.remove(jobId, 'upload')` first — prevents the old queued photo uploading after the driver retakes

If the device has no connectivity when a driver taps "Mark Complete":

1. The operation is enqueued and the job is **optimistically marked complete locally** — the driver sees the job as done immediately
2. No error is shown — from the driver's perspective, the tap succeeded
3. On next session load, the queued mark-complete is flushed to Supabase

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Expo CLI: `npm install -g expo-cli`
- Supabase CLI (for migrations): `brew install supabase/tap/supabase`
- Xcode (for iOS simulator)
- A Supabase project with the schema applied

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Apply database migrations

```bash
supabase db push
```

---

## Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` in the project root. This file is gitignored — never commit it.

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

The service role key is never used in the app. Admin write access is controlled via Supabase Auth sessions and RLS policies.

---

## Running the App

### iOS (simulator or device)

```bash
npm run ios
# or
npx expo start
```

### Android

```bash
npm run android
```

### Web (for Electron development)

```bash
npm run web:dev
```

### Electron (Windows desktop admin)

Build the web output first, then launch Electron:

```bash
npm run electron
```

For development (skip the build step, uses last web build):

```bash
npm run electron:dev
```

---

## Building for Production

### iOS (EAS Build)

```bash
eas build --platform ios
```

### Windows (Electron)

```bash
npm run web           # exports to dist/
npx electron .        # or package with electron-builder
```

Admin on iOS and admin on Windows run identical React code — only the shell differs.

## Design System

The full design system lives in `src/screens/CLAUDE.md` and `src/utils/colors.ts`. Key principles:

- **Brand**: Two colours only — white and `#147EC4` (sky blue). No gradients, no third colour.
- **Contrast**: WCAG AAA (7:1) minimum. `colors.bg` + `colors.textPrimary` achieves 16:1. Direct sunlight reduces effective contrast by ~50%.
- **Touch targets**: 56pt minimum (bare fingers), 64pt for primary actions (gloved hands).
- **Admin mode**: Light background, blue accents.
- **Driver mode**: Dark background — reduces glare in outdoor conditions.
- **Advancing action button**: One primary CTA per job screen. Its label and colour change as job state advances. The driver never decides what to do next.
- **Raw hex values are banned in StyleSheets** — always use tokens from `src/utils/colors.ts`.

## Contributing

### Layer rules

Before editing any file, read the `CLAUDE.md` in that layer's directory. Each layer has strict import rules and patterns that keep the codebase maintainable.

### Adding a database column

1. Create a new migration file (e.g. `005_add_column.sql`) — never edit pushed migrations
2. Update the relevant type in `src/data/`
3. Update any service that reads or writes that table
4. Run `supabase db push`

### Non-negotiable constraints

- Photo is mandatory before "Mark Complete" — for installs and removals
- `canMarkComplete(jobId)` lives in the store, never in a screen
- Storage keys only — never store or pass signed URLs
- GPS is passed as a parameter to upload functions — never read inside a service
- `supabase.auth` is never called for driver flows
- `agent_email` must come from the Sheets import — never hardcoded
